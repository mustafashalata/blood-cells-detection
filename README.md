# blood-cells-detection

The blood cells detection project is a computer vision application that aims to identify and classify different types of blood cells in an image using deep learning techniques.

The project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect and classify four different types of blood cells: red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and lymphocytes. The model is trained on a dataset of microscopic images of blood cell samples, which are annotated with labels indicating the type of cell present in the image.

The project involves preprocessing the raw images, such as resizing and normalizing the images, before feeding them into the CNN. The CNN architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to extract features from the images and classify them into the different cell types.

The project's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model's high accuracy in detecting and classifying blood cells can aid in the diagnosis of various blood-related diseases and disorders, including leukemia and anemia.
